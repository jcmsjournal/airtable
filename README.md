# Airtable Base Documentation

The JCMS workflow software is hosted by AirTable. We have two different pieces of software to do two different things: Submissions Portal and Readers and Reports. The Submissions Portal manages the open call submissions of research articles, as well as the desk review pipeline. Readers and Reports, meanwhile, manages the peer review process.

These are not total solutions: each of these captures and manages a linear part of the process.

This repository is a guide to working with this software.

You'll find [the documentation for Submissions Portal here](submissions-portal/index.md) and [the documentation for Readers and Reports here](readers-and-reports/index.md).

AirTable documentation is extensive. The portal page is https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us. The getting started series of pages is availabel at https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003922433-Getting-started-with-Airtable.

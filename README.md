# Airtable Base Documentation

The JCMS workflow software is hosted by AirTable. We have three different pieces of software to do three different things: Submissions Portal, Readers and Reports, and Post-decision Pipeline. The Submissions Portal manages the open call submissions of research articles, as well as the desk review pipeline. Readers and Reports, meanwhile, manages the peer review process. The Post-decision Pipeline is for managing research articles that are in revision, as well all pieces (articles and other content) that are accepted into _JCMS_.

These are not total solutions: each of these captures and manages a linear part of the process.

This repository is a guide to working with this software.

You'll find [the documentation for Submissions Portal here](submissions-portal.md), [the documentation for Readers and Reports here](readers-and-reports/.md), and [the documentation for the Post-decision Pipeline here](post-decision-pipeline.md).

AirTable documentation is extensive. The portal page is https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us. The getting started series of pages is availabel at https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003922433-Getting-started-with-Airtable.
